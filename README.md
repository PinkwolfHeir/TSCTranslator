# TSC Latex Translator
If you ever want to speak [Thunder Scientific Corporation's](https://www.roblox.com/games/7131355525) Latex language, you can do it with this single HTML file.

The original idea is made by **[nikothegamer](https://github.com/nikothegamer100)**, you can check their translator **[here](https://nikothegamer100.github.io/latex-language-translator/)**

## The translator includes
> - Keyboard
> - Useless information you don't need to know
> - I don't know anymore.

Oh yeah it has no licensing so feel free to yoink it lol.
